# Taming webdev

My acquaintance with web development a.k.a frontend is long and boring. It's
something I tried at the very beginning of my journey with programming and since
then, I didn't like it. To be honest, I hated it.

I've tried to learn frontend every time I felt like I needed a simple website,
but I always ended up spending 2 hours on something as stupid as centering text
or making footer stick to the bottom. And by saying "learn", I mean being able
to create a simple site powered only by pure HTML and CSS.

I've tried to _like_ frontend many times over the years, but frontend never
liked me back. It's too messy. Too irritating. The plethora of ways to do one
thing intimidates me, an Android guy used that official docs always present _the
right way_ to do almost everything.

I was always telling myself "you'll learn it someday, when you'll have more
time" - classic example of procrastination. Now, in the middle (?) of
coronavirus outbreak, my school has been closed for 2 weeks and I'm basically
free to spend this time in any way I want. So I thought:

**Let's learn frontend**

Status update in 2 weeks.

(Knowing me, I will get tired of it tomorrow or the day after and I'll never
write a continuation)
